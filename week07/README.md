#### Question 1

Write a function **to_upper()** which takes **a char** as input, and returns the upper case version of the character if it is a lower case letter. Otherwise it should return the same character.

Then write a program which reads a word from the user, and prints it with upper case characters. Assume valid words will be given.

| Input    | Output   |
| -------- | -------- |
| cMpe     | CMPE     |
| funCTi0n | FUNCTI0N |

#### Question 2

Write a function **find_max()** which takes three integers as parameters and returns **maximum** among them. Then, call this function in main() function with the following inputs and print corresponding outputs.

| Input   | Output |
| ------- | ------ |
| 5 3 8   | 8      |
| 14 -1 9 | 14     |

#### Question 3

Write functions that compute the factorial f(n)=n!, permutation, P(n,k)=n!/(n-k)!, and the combinatorial, C(n,k)=n!/(n-k)! k!, of two numbers n and k, where n>0, k>0, and n â‰¥ k. 

Then write a function named **selection** whose parameters are a char and two integers. If the character is **C**, calls combinatorial function with the integer parameters and return the result. If the character is **P**, calls permutation function and return the result. Otherwise, returns -1.

| Function    | Input | Output |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| factorial   | 5     | 120    |
| permutation | 5 2   | 20     |
| combination | 5 2   | 10     |
| selection   | C 5 2 | 10     |
| selection   | P 5 2 | 20     |
| selection   | X 5 2 | -1     |

#### Question 4

Write a function named **fetchDigit** which takes two integers as input: **number** and **n**. Function should return the nth digit (from the right) of the number as an integer. If the number is less than n digits, Function should return -1. 

Then write a program which reads a positive integer z and another integer x, then print out the xth digit of z. If the input is incorrect (z doesn't have x digits), program should print "Incorrect input". Assume negative integers will not be given. 

| Input    | Output          |
| -------- | --------------- |
| 23423 3  | 4               |
| 204602 5 | 0               |
| 52 9     | Incorrect input |

<details><summary>Steps</summary>
<p>23423,	   last_digit = 3, 	number = 2342, ctr = 1</p>

<p>2342,		 last_digit = 2,	number = 234,  ctr = 2</p>

<p>234,		   last_digit = 4, 	number = 23,   ctr = 3</p>
</details>

#### Question 5

Write a function named **pyramid** which takes an integer as input: **num_of_rows**, then prints the pyramid of numbers increased by 1 shown below. This function shouldn't return anything.

| Input | Output                                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 4     | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2 3<br />&nbsp;4 5 6<br />7 8 9 10 |
| 3     | &nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />&nbsp;2 3<br />4 5 6                   |

#### Question 6

Write a function **is_perfect()** that checks whether the given number is perfect. Perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. The function prints the positive divisors and returns 1 if the number is perfect and returns 0 otherwise. 

| Input | Output     | Return |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| 5     | 1          | 0      |
| 6     | 1 2 3      | 1      |
| 28    | 1 2 4 7 14 | 1      |
| 12    | 1 2 3 4 6  | 0      |

#### Question 7

Write a function that will take an integer number and return its reverse version as another integer. Then fill/write main() appropriately to see the result.		

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1234  | 4321   |
| 68436 | 63486  |

<details><summary>Reverse</summary>
<p>1234 % 10  = 4, 1234 / 10 = 123 0 * 10 + 4</p>, 
<p>123 % 10 = 3, 123 / 10 = 12,  4 * 10 + 3</p>
<p>12 % 10 = 2, 12 / 10 = 1, 43 * 10 + 2</p>
<p>1 % 10 = 1, 1 / 10 = 0, 432 * 10 + 1</p>
=> <bold>4321</bold>
</details>

#### Question 8

Write a function that will take an integer as a parameter. Then calculates and returns its binary version as another integer. Then write main appropriately to see the result.	

| Input | Output     |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 25    | 11001      |
| 532   | 1000010100 |
| 5     | 101        |

<details><summary>Conversion</summary>
<p>25 / 2 = 12 with 1 remainder (units)  1 * 10^0</p>
<p>12 / 2 = 6 with 0 remainder (tens) 0 * 10^1 </p>
<p>6 / 2 = 3 with 0 remainder (hundreds) 0 * 10^2 </p>
<p>3 / 2 = 1 with 1 remainder (thousands) 1 * 10^3 </p>
<p>1 / 2 = 0 with 1 remainder 1 * 10^4 </p>
=> <bold>11001</bold>
</details>  

#### Question 9

Write a function that will take a positive integer n, and returns the nth Fibonacci number. Then write main appropriately to see the result.

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1     | 0      |
| 2     | 1      |
| 3     | 1      |
| 4     | 2      |
| 5     | 3      |
| 10    | 34     |
